SHORT DESCRIPTION
    DHPutty helps manage PuTTY Sessions

LONG DESCRIPTION
    DHPutty supports PuTTYSession operations of get, new, rename, remove, and
    start. A PuTTYSession object represents an instance that maps to a stored
    session in HKCU, which contains over 200 properties and values. The
    Start-PuTTYSession can be thought of as starting a PuTTY process from the
    referenced stored session configuration.
    PuttySessionPropertySet object operations include get & set. Initially, the
    PuttySessionPropertySet functions were going to be private, but exporting
    them makes it easier for PowerShell scripters to manipulate configuration
    sets to extend functionality. This could take the form of persisting
    property sets in files, defining color themes, or possibly authentication options.
    The New-PuttySession function uses an existing stored session as the
    template for creating a new one. The primary properties given to
    New-PuttySession overwrite the corresponding template properties. When
    storing a new session via the PuTTY GUI it is common to use the hostname as
    the name of the session, but the matching ability of Get-PuttySession allows
    the name (and Title) to convey any additional information you might find
    useful. So, in addition to finding and starting up sessions where hostnames
    match a certain pattern, you can extend that to matching session names, or
    matching Titles.
    By incorporating the WinTitle as a PuttySession property, you can easily map
    running PuTTY processes via the MainWindowTitle in a
    System.Diagnostics.Process.

    PS> Get-Process -Name Putty | where MainWindowTitle -like '*created by DHPutty*'

PuTTY VERSIONS
    In addition to the standard PuTTY versions, this module can also handle
    Centrify PuTTY. Centrify adds an extra set of properties relating to
    Kerboros connectivity. The IsCentrify property denotes whether this is a
    Centrify or standard PuTTY session configuration.

EXAMPLES
    PS> Get-PuttySession -Hostname "*apache*" | Start-PuttySession
    PS> Get-PuttySession -Name BlackOnPink -Property All

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Either an executable or PowerShell alias by the name of putty must be
    available in order for the Start-PuttySession cmdlet to function properly.
    To confirm this, make sure PuTTY is output when the following command is
    run>

    Get-Command putty

NOTE
    The DHPutty module uses registry cmdlets that are generated using CDXML. The
    registry.csxml is only slightly modified from the one presented by Richard
    Siddaway in the Scripting Guys series.
    The PlatyPS module is used on the markdown file in Docs to produce the
    actual external documentaion in the en-us folder of the module. Comment
    based help in DHPutty.psm1 for the functions will be removed in the near
    future. From with the DHPutty folder the following command is used to
    refresh the external help files>

    New-ExternalHelp .\Docs -OutputPath en-US\ -Force

SEE ALSO
    Various other PuTTY modules are in the PowerShellGallery which may be of
    interest.
